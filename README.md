My favorite editor is Sublime Text Code Editor. 

The reason number one: I can use it for any type of programming language. In the View chose Syntax, and you can see all the language syntaxes available. I have all of the most common languages. After choosing the syntax, the entered code will have highlighted keywords.

Reason number two: The Sublime Text Code Editor is free. Since I am a student and I have to learn a lot of new languages it's important for me to don't spend money on each new language-specific editor. I can use Sublime for all of them. Also, all the new versions of Sublime available for free.

Reason number three: Sublime Text Code Editor lightweight, fast and stable. The program doesn't take much space in my laptop memory, it's fast on using and I don't have any issues since many years of usage of Sublime, so I can defiantly say it's stable.
